## ðŸš€ How to use in DEVELOPMENT

- Install packages with `yarn`.
- Reach out to me so I can add you to the test database environment (it's a playgroup to mess around so we don't corrupt production database)
- Run `yarn start` to start the bundler.
- When metro bundler opens up choose `i` to open in ios.
